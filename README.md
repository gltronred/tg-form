4. Share the spreadsheet with a user `demo-bot-account@ozi-tg-cec.iam.gserviceaccount.com`.
Copy the address of the spreadsheet.
5. Start a [bot](https://t.me/tg_forms_bot). Send it a command `/newsheet
<address-of-spreadsheet>` and it will reply with a link. You can send this link
to your audience and start collecting responses.

You can fill this form yourself and leave us a feedback here: https://t.me/tg_forms_bot?start=TESTFORM

# Pricing

## It's free!

However, there are limitations. There are server payments, limits on Google API
calls, programmer's man-hours of supporting and other sad things.

So your free form will be available for two weeks (this duration can be updated
if demand in forms increases), and after that you will not be able to collect
new responses. Old responses are, of course, kept in your Google sheet.

## Supporting

If you like this software and want to help me develop it, you can support me.

If you subscribe to a [regular
donation](https://liberapay.com/gltronred/donate), I will be able to devote more
time to developing and supporting this project. It is well known that
mathematicians and programmers use coffee as a fuel ☺ and you can [buy me a
coffee](https://buymeacoff.ee/gltronred) to support my work.

Of course, you can help the project by filling an issue or preparing PR - it is
open-source, after all.

## Self-hosting

The bot works on our servers. We do our best to make this process safe and
smooth. But you can have higher requirements for it that we can provide.

If you want to collect responses on your server, you can self-host your own
version of the bot. Please read [the manual](docs/reference.md) on building and
deploying the bot.

Also I can consult you about self-hosting the bot, or you can hire me to deploy
it to your server. Please [contact me](#author) for details.

## Commercial license

This software is licensed under [Affero GPL v3 or any later version](LICENSE).
This means that if you use the unmodified bot on your server or if you modify
the bot you have to provide the source of the bot (or its modified version).

If use of the software under this license does not satify your organization's
legal department, commercial licenses are available. Please [contact
me](#author) for details.
